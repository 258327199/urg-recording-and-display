# urg-recording-and-display
For easily recording and displaying lidar scans from the Hokuyo URG-04lX-UG01
Used in conjunction with [Dan Moore's ofxURG library](https://github.com/danthemellowman/ofxUrg) (sender app).

Apps:
urg_recording is used for static recordings (i.e. only recording lidar data). It can also render real-time recordings.
urg_recording_2 is used for dynamic recordings (i.e. recording lidar data in addition to orientation).
urg_capture_display is used to display these recordings, from various .csv data formats and in various drawing modes.

Examples of projects that can be made with these apps include those documented [here](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/benjamin/Project%203/Project%203.md).

Developed in Golan Levin's class Experimental Capture, Carnegie Mellon University Fall 2015
