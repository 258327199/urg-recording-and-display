# urg-recording-and-display

--- [UPDATED APP FOR OF 9.3 WITH EXAMPLES INCLUDED HERE](https://github.com/bensnell/urg_recording_and_display_2) ---


For easily recording and displaying lidar scans from the Hokuyo URG-04lX-UG01

Used in conjunction with [Dan Moore's ofxURG library](https://github.com/danthemellowman/ofxUrg) (sender app).

Apps:
- urg_recording is used for static recordings (i.e. only recording lidar data). It can also render real-time recordings.
- urg_recording_2 is used for dynamic recordings (i.e. recording lidar data in addition to orientation).
- urg_capture_display is used to display these recordings, from various .csv data formats and in various drawing modes.
- urg_shaders_6 is for rendering large spherical point clouds with depth of field and perlin noise ([video](https://vimeo.com/148699844))
- urg_shaders_7 is for rendering temporalized hallways, as in the Carnegie Museum capture ([video](https://vimeo.com/151335007))

Examples of projects that can be made with these apps include those documented [here](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/benjamin/Project%203/Project%203.md) and [here](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/benjamin/Final%20Project/Final%20Project.md).

Developed in Golan Levin's class Experimental Capture, Carnegie Mellon University Fall 2015
